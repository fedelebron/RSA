This is an example implementation of the RSA algorithm.

You can compile it with:
	
	g++ RSA.cpp sha1.cpp -lgmp -lgmpxx -o RSA

It requires the GMP (Gnu Multiple Precision) libraries to compile, as well as their C++ bindings.
(Of course, you may substitute g++ with any suitable C++ compiler.)

The on-screen instructions should be self-explanatory. It will generate two primes on the fly, create a private and public key, encrypt, and then decrypt your message. All the information is printed to stdout.

Run it as:

	./RSA


The library sha1.cpp and its header sha1.h were written by Micael Hildenborg, whom I have no affiliation with.
